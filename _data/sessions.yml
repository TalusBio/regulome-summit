ai-ml:
  blurb:  Models matter only if they predict and explain biology well enough to change decisions. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in building and testing models for actionable biology insights, then connect those models to industry applications such as screening design and target triage.

epigenetics:
  blurb: The nucleus is a complex biomolecular environment where proteins, DNA, and RNA interact in ways that challenge conventional measurement. We compare our favorite—and least favorite—technologies for studying the regulome, where improvement is most needed, and which questions better tools could answer.

undruggable:
  blurb: This panel will bring together scientists and industry leaders, to discuss emerging strategies for targeting historically “undruggable” proteins such as transcription factors and chromatin regulators. Panelists will share perspectives on scientific breakthroughs, challenges in drug discovery, and the impact these advances could have on patients with cancers like chordoma, where the TBXT driver has long resisted therapeutic intervention.

keynote:
  blurb: Frontier view on nuclear proteomics and translational impact.

nwsf:
  blurb: This session will highlight the challenges and opportunities of developing therapies for chordoma, a rare bone cancer driven by the transcription factor TBXT. Featuring the president of the Northwest Sarcoma Foundation, Dr. Schaub, and two patients with chordoma, the discussion will bridge advocacy, lived experience, and scientific innovation, underscoring the importance of collaboration in advancing treatments for rare cancers.
