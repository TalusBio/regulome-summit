## What this is
A one day meeting where chromatin biologists, proteomicists, and AI teams align on interdisciplinary collaboration that moves drug programs forward for challenging regulome targets. Sponsored by [Talus Bio.](https://www.talus.bio/)

## Why now
Clinical urgency is rising for chromatin-associated diseases, but technological and computational methods have emerged and matured to tackle these targets. This summit connects those threads into insights, lessons learned, and next steps as a community.

## Getting to UW Dempsey Hall:

Parking details: 
Parking is best found in the visitor section of the Central Plaza Garage lot where you will use the PayByPhone app to register and pay for your license plate.

To pay for parking you need to download the PayByPhone app. You will be able to input your section and pay once you leave the parking garage and have cell service.

It's about an 8 minute walk to Dempsey Hall. Once you enter Dempsey Hall, take the elevator or stairs to the third floor, where you will see the check-in table outside Anthony's Forum for the event! (Note: Paccar Hall is adjacent to Dempsey Hall and share floors however floor 2 of Paccar enters on floor 3 of Dempsey)

## Highlights

- **Northwest Sarcoma Foundation**: Patient need sets the frame and motivates our efforts. We discuss where regulome targets inform stratification, endpoints, and trial design in sarcoma, plus gaps in drug discovery and biomarkers that collaboration across our community could close.

- **AI and ML for Discovery**: Models matter only if they predict and explain biology well enough to change decisions. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in building and testing models for actionable biology insights, then connect those models to industry applications such as screening design and target triage. 
  
- **Epigenetics and Chromatin Dynamics**: The nucleus is a highly complex biomolecular environment where proteins, DNA, and RNA all interact in ways that challenge conventional biochemical measurement approaches. We discuss our favorite, and least favorite, technologies for studying the regulome, where there is opportunity to improve, and what biology could be answered with better tools.

- **Drugging the Undruggable**: Transcriptional targets live in the nucleus and assemble into large, dynamic complexes, so many delivery technologies and pocket-centric chemistries fall short. We'll talk about chemistry and modality choices, what is needed to make these programs tractable, and the data that moves a regulome-focused drug discovery program from target to hit to lead.
